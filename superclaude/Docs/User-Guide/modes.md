## Getting Started (2-Minute Overview)

**Modes activate through behavioral instructions** - Claude Code reads context files to determine which mode behaviors to adopt based on your task patterns and complexity.

**Quick Examples:**
```bash
# Automatic activation examples
/sc:brainstorm "mobile app"        # → Socratic discovery questions
/sc:implement "auth system"        # → Multi-phase coordination  
"--uc analyze large-codebase/"     # → Compressed symbol output
```

**When to use manual flags:**
- Need specific behavior: `--brainstorm`, `--introspect`, `--uc`
- Override automatic detection for learning/debugging
- Optimize for specific constraints (memory, time, clarity)

---

## Mode Details

### 🧠 Brainstorming Mode - Interactive Discovery

**Purpose**: Transform vague ideas into structured requirements through collaborative discovery.

**Auto-Activation Triggers:**
- Vague project requests: "I want to build...", "Thinking about creating..."
- Exploration keywords: brainstorm, explore, discuss, figure out, not sure
- Uncertainty indicators: "maybe", "possibly", "could we"
- Manual flags: `--brainstorm`, `--bs`

**Behavioral Changes:**
- **Socratic Questioning**: Asks probing questions to uncover hidden requirements
- **Non-Presumptive Approach**: Avoids assumptions, lets you guide discovery direction
- **Collaborative Partnership**: Works with you in exploration rather than directive consultation
- **Requirement Synthesis**: Converts insights into structured technical briefs
- **Cross-Session Memory**: Maintains discovery context for follow-up discussions

**Example Experience:**
```
Standard Approach: "I'll build a user authentication system with JWT tokens..."
Brainstorming Approach: 
"🤔 Let's explore this together:
 - What specific user problems does auth solve for your app?
 - Who are your users and what's their technical comfort level?  
 - Any existing systems or social logins to integrate with?
 - What security/compliance requirements do you have?
 📝 Outcome: Detailed auth requirements brief ready for implementation"
```

#### Success Criteria  
- [ ] Responds with questions instead of immediate solutions
- [ ] Questions explore user needs, technical constraints, and business goals
- [ ] Maintains collaborative tone throughout discovery process
- [ ] Produces structured requirements or technical brief as outcome

**Verify:** `/sc:brainstorm "web app"` should ask about users, features, technology  
**Test:** Vague requests should trigger discovery questions, not assumptions  
**Check:** Mode should persist across follow-up questions in same conversation

**Works Best With:**
- **→ Task Management**: Requirements discovery → systematic implementation planning
- **→ Orchestration**: Requirements clarity → optimal tool selection for implementation
- **Manual Override**: Use `--brainstorm` to force discovery even for "clear" requirements
