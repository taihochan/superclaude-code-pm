# SuperClaude Agents Guide ü§ñ

SuperClaude provides 15 domain specialist agents that Claude Code can invoke for specialized expertise.


## üß™ Testing Agent Activation

Before using this guide, verify agent selection works:

```bash
# Test manual agent invocation
@agent-python-expert "explain decorators"
# Example behavior: Python expert responds with detailed explanation

# Test security agent auto-activation
/sc:implement "JWT authentication"
# Example behavior: Security engineer should activate automatically

# Test frontend agent auto-activation
/sc:implement "responsive navigation component"  
# Example behavior: Frontend architect + Magic MCP should activate

# Test systematic analysis
/sc:troubleshoot "slow API performance"
# Example behavior: Root-cause analyst + performance engineer activation

# Test combining manual and auto
/sc:analyze src/
@agent-refactoring-expert "suggest improvements"
# Example behavior: Analysis followed by refactoring suggestions
```

**If tests fail**: Check agent files exist in `~/.claude/agents/` or restart Claude Code session

## Core Concepts

### What are SuperClaude Agents?
**Agents** are specialized AI domain experts implemented as context instructions that modify Claude Code's behavior. Each agent is a carefully crafted `.md` file in the `SuperClaude/Agents/` directory containing domain-specific expertise, behavioral patterns, and problem-solving approaches.

**Important**: Agents are NOT separate AI models or software - they are context configurations that Claude Code reads to adopt specialized behaviors.

### Two Ways to Use Agents

#### 1. Manual Invocation with @agent- Prefix
```bash
# Directly invoke a specific agent
@agent-security "review authentication implementation"
@agent-frontend "design responsive navigation"
@agent-architect "plan microservices migration"
```

#### 2. Auto-Activation (Behavioral Routing)
"Auto-activation" means Claude Code reads behavioral instructions to engage appropriate contexts based on keywords and patterns in your requests. SuperClaude provides behavioral guidelines that Claude follows to route to the most appropriate specialists.

> **üìù How Agent "Auto-Activation" Works**: 
> Agent activation isn't automatic system logic - it's behavioral instructions in context files. 
> When documentation says agents "auto-activate", it means Claude Code reads instructions to engage 
> specific domain expertise based on keywords and patterns in your request. This creates the 
> experience of intelligent routing while being transparent about the underlying mechanism.

```bash
# These commands auto-activate relevant agents
/sc:implement "JWT authentication"  # ‚Üí security-engineer auto-activates
/sc:design "React dashboard"        # ‚Üí frontend-architect auto-activates
/sc:troubleshoot "memory leak"      # ‚Üí performance-engineer auto-activates
```

**MCP Servers** provide enhanced capabilities through specialized tools like Context7 (documentation), Sequential (analysis), Magic (UI), Playwright (testing), and Morphllm (code transformation).

**Domain Specialists** focus on narrow expertise areas to provide deeper, more accurate solutions than generalist approaches.

### Agent Selection Rules

**Priority Hierarchy:**
1. **Manual Override** - @agent-[name] takes precedence over auto-activation
2. **Keywords** - Direct domain terminology triggers primary agents
3. **File Types** - Extensions activate language/framework specialists  
4. **Complexity** - Multi-step tasks engage coordination agents
5. **Context** - Related concepts trigger complementary agents

**Conflict Resolution:**
- Manual invocation ‚Üí Specified agent takes priority
- Multiple matches ‚Üí Multi-agent coordination
- Unclear context ‚Üí Requirements analyst activation
- High complexity ‚Üí System architect oversight
- Quality concerns ‚Üí Automatic QA agent inclusion

**Selection Decision Tree:**
```
Task Analysis ‚Üí
‚îú‚îÄ Manual @agent-? ‚Üí Use specified agent
‚îú‚îÄ Single Domain? ‚Üí Activate primary agent
‚îú‚îÄ Multi-Domain? ‚Üí Coordinate specialist agents  
‚îú‚îÄ Complex System? ‚Üí Add system-architect oversight
‚îú‚îÄ Quality Critical? ‚Üí Include security + performance + quality agents
‚îî‚îÄ Learning Focus? ‚Üí Add learning-guide + technical-writer
```

## Quick Start Examples

### Manual Agent Invocation
```bash
# Explicitly call specific agents with @agent- prefix
@agent-python-expert "optimize this data processing pipeline"
@agent-quality-engineer "create comprehensive test suite"
@agent-technical-writer "document this API with examples"
@agent-socratic-mentor "explain this design pattern"
```

### Automatic Agent Coordination
```bash
# Commands that trigger auto-activation
/sc:implement "JWT authentication with rate limiting"
# ‚Üí Triggers: security-engineer + backend-architect + quality-engineer

/sc:design "accessible React dashboard with documentation"
# ‚Üí Triggers: frontend-architect + learning-guide + technical-writer  

/sc:troubleshoot "slow deployment pipeline with intermittent failures"
# ‚Üí Triggers: devops-architect + performance-engineer + root-cause-analyst

/sc:audit "payment processing security vulnerabilities"
# ‚Üí Triggers: security-engineer + quality-engineer + refactoring-expert
```

### Combining Manual and Auto Approaches
```bash
# Start with command (auto-activation)
/sc:implement "user profile system"

# Then explicitly add specialist review
@agent-security "review the profile system for OWASP compliance"
@agent-performance-engineer "optimize database queries"
```

### Troubleshooting Agent Activation

## Troubleshooting

For troubleshooting help, see:
- [Common Issues](../Reference/common-issues.md) - Quick fixes for frequent problems
- [Troubleshooting Guide](../Reference/troubleshooting.md) - Comprehensive problem resolution

### Common Issues
- **No agent activation**: Use domain keywords: "security", "performance", "frontend"
- **Wrong agents selected**: Check trigger keywords in agent documentation
- **Too many agents**: Focus keywords on primary domain or use `/sc:focus [domain]`
- **Agents not coordinating**: Increase task complexity or use multi-domain keywords
- **Agent expertise mismatch**: Use more specific technical terminology

### Immediate Fixes
- **Force agent activation**: Use explicit domain keywords in requests
- **Reset agent selection**: Restart Claude Code session to reset agent state
- **Check agent patterns**: Review trigger keywords in agent documentation
- **Test basic activation**: Try `/sc:implement "security auth"` to test security-engineer

### Agent-Specific Troubleshooting

**No Security Agent:**
```bash
# Problem: Security concerns not triggering security-engineer
# Quick Fix: Use explicit security keywords
"implement authentication"              # Generic - may not trigger
"implement JWT authentication security" # Explicit - triggers security-engineer
"secure user login with encryption"    # Security focus - triggers security-engineer
```

**No Performance Agent:**
```bash
# Problem: Performance issues not triggering performance-engineer
# Quick Fix: Use performance-specific terminology
"make it faster"                       # Vague - may not trigger
"optimize slow database queries"       # Specific - triggers performance-engineer  
"reduce API latency and bottlenecks"   # Performance focus - triggers performance-engineer
```

**No Architecture Agent:**
```bash
# Problem: System design not triggering architecture agents
# Quick Fix: Use architectural keywords
"build an app"                         # Generic - triggers basic agents
"design microservices architecture"    # Specific - triggers system-architect
"scalable distributed system design"   # Architecture focus - triggers system-architect
```

**Wrong Agent Combination:**
```bash
# Problem: Getting frontend agent for backend tasks
# Quick Fix: Use domain-specific terminology
"create user interface"                # May trigger frontend-architect
"create REST API endpoints"            # Specific - triggers backend-architect
"implement server-side authentication" # Backend focus - triggers backend-architect
```

### Support Levels

- [ ] Complex tasks trigger multi-agent coordination (3+ agents)
- [ ] Agent expertise matches task requirements (API ‚Üí backend-architect)
- [ ] Quality agents auto-include when appropriate (security, performance, testing)
- [ ] Responses show domain expertise and specialized knowledge

## Quick Troubleshooting (Legacy)
- **No agent activation** ‚Üí Use domain keywords: "security", "performance", "frontend"
- **Wrong agents** ‚Üí Check trigger keywords in agent documentation
- **Too many agents** ‚Üí Focus keywords on primary domain
- **Agents not coordinating** ‚Üí Increase task complexity or use multi-domain keywords

**Agent Not Activating?**
1. **Check Keywords**: Use domain-specific terminology (e.g., "authentication" not "login" for security-engineer)
2. **Add Context**: Include file types, frameworks, or specific technologies
3. **Increase Complexity**: Multi-domain problems trigger more agents
4. **Use Examples**: Reference concrete scenarios that match agent expertise

**Too Many Agents?**
- Focus keywords on primary domain needs
- Use `/sc:focus [domain]` to limit scope
- Start with specific agents, expand as needed

**Wrong Agents?**
- Review trigger keywords in agent documentation
- Use more specific terminology for target domain
- Add explicit requirements or constraints

### Advanced Agent Coordination

**Multi-Domain Projects:**
- **Start Broad**: Begin with system-level keywords to engage architecture agents
- **Add Specificity**: Include domain-specific needs to activate specialist agents  
- **Quality Integration**: Automatically include security, performance, and testing perspectives
- **Documentation Inclusion**: Add learning or documentation needs for comprehensive coverage

**Troubleshooting Agent Selection:**

**Problem: Wrong agents activating**
- Solution: Use more specific domain terminology
- Example: "database optimization" ‚Üí performance-engineer + backend-architect

**Problem: Not enough agents**  
- Solution: Increase complexity indicators and cross-domain keywords
- Example: Add "security", "performance", "documentation" to requests

**Problem: Too many agents**
- Solution: Focus on primary domain with specific technical terms
- Example: Use "/sc:focus backend" to limit scope

### Quality-Driven Development

**Security-First Approach:**
Always include security considerations in development requests to automatically engage security-engineer alongside domain specialists.

**Performance Integration:**
Include performance keywords ("fast", "efficient", "scalable") to ensure performance-engineer coordination from the start.

**Accessibility Compliance:**
Use "accessible", "WCAG", or "inclusive" to automatically include accessibility validation in frontend development.

**Documentation Culture:**
Add "documented", "explained", or "tutorial" to requests for automatic technical-writer inclusion and knowledge transfer.

## Understanding Agent Intelligence üß†

### What Makes Agents Effective

**Domain Expertise**: Each agent has specialized knowledge patterns, behavioral approaches, and problem-solving methodologies specific to their domain.

**Contextual Activation**: Agents analyze request context, not just keywords, to determine relevance and engagement level.

**Collaborative Intelligence**: Multi-agent coordination produces synergistic results that exceed individual agent capabilities.

**Adaptive Learning**: Agent selection improves based on request patterns and successful coordination outcomes.

### Agent vs. Traditional AI

**Traditional Approach**: Single AI handles all domains with varying levels of expertise
**Agent Approach**: Specialized experts collaborate with deep domain knowledge and focused problem-solving

**Benefits**:
- Higher accuracy in domain-specific tasks
- More sophisticated problem-solving methodologies  
- Better quality assurance through specialist review
- Coordinated multi-perspective analysis

### Trust the System, Understand the Patterns

**What to Expect**:
- Automatic routing to appropriate domain experts
- Multi-agent coordination for complex tasks
- Quality integration through automatic QA agent inclusion
- Learning opportunities through educational agent activation

**What Not to Worry About**:
- Manual agent selection or configuration
- Complex routing rules or agent management
- Agent configuration or coordination
- Micromanaging agent interactions
