# Contributing Context Files to SuperClaude Framework üõ†Ô∏è

Welcome to SuperClaude Framework development! This guide provides everything you need to contribute context files and behavioral instructions that enhance Claude Code through structured prompts and MCP server integration.

**Project Purpose**: SuperClaude provides Claude Code with structured context files and behavioral instructions. We're building the next generation of AI-assisted development through intelligent prompt engineering.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

**Required:**
- Python 3.8+ with pip
- Git for version control
- Claude Code installed and working
- Node.js 16+ (for MCP server configuration)

**Environment Setup:**
```bash
# Fork SuperClaude_Framework on GitHub first
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/SuperClaude_Framework.git
cd SuperClaude_Framework

# Test installation system
PYTHONPATH=/path/to/SuperClaude_Framework python3 -m setup --help

# Install to development location
PYTHONPATH=/path/to/SuperClaude_Framework python3 -m setup install --components core
```

**Validation Check:**
```bash
# Verify Python version
python3 --version  # Should be 3.8+

# Check Node.js for MCP configuration
node --version     # Should be 16+

# Test Claude Code integration
ls ~/.claude/      # Should show Claude Code directory
```

## Architecture Overview

### Framework Structure

SuperClaude is a **Context-Oriented Configuration Framework** - not executing software, but instruction files that Claude Code reads to modify its behavior.

```
SuperClaude_Framework/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SuperClaude/           # Framework components (the source of truth)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Core/             # PRINCIPLES.md, RULES.md, FLAGS.md
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Agents/           # 15 specialized domain experts
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Commands/         # 21 context trigger patterns (/sc: behavioral instructions)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Modes/            # 6 behavioral modification patterns
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ MCP/              # 6 MCP server configurations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ setup/                # Python installation system
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Docs/                 # Documentation (what you're reading)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/                # File validation scripts
```

**Key Concepts:**
- **Context Files**: .md instruction files that guide Claude Code behavior
- **Agents**: Domain specialists (e.g., security-engineer.md, python-expert.md)
- **Commands**: Workflow patterns (e.g., implement.md, analyze.md)
- **Modes**: Interaction modifiers (e.g., brainstorming, introspection)
- **MCP Integration**: Configuration for Model Context Protocol servers

### How It Works

```
User Input ‚Üí Claude Code ‚Üí Reads SuperClaude Context ‚Üí Modified Behavior ‚Üí Enhanced Output
```

1. User types `/sc:implement "auth system"` **in Claude Code conversation** (not terminal)
2. Claude Code reads `SuperClaude/Commands/implement.md`
3. Command activates security-engineer agent context
4. Context7 MCP provides authentication patterns
5. Claude generates complete, secure implementation

## Context File Guidelines

### File Organization

**Context Files (`.md`):**
- Write clear, actionable instructions for Claude Code
- Use frontmatter metadata for configuration
- Follow existing patterns and naming conventions
- Test instructions produce expected behaviors

**Installation Scripts (`.py`):**
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Include docstrings for functions and classes
- Add type hints where beneficial
- Focus on file copying and configuration

**Example Agent Structure:**
```markdown
---
name: new-specialist
description: Brief description of expertise
category: specialized|architecture|quality
---

# Agent Name

## Triggers
- Keywords that activate this agent
- File types that trigger activation

## Behavioral Mindset
